# Image Processing

This project implements a hardware-based image processing system in Verilog that performs various operations on RGB images, including grayscale conversion, inversion (negative), thresholding, and Gaussian blur.

## Features

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Convert RGB to grayscale using proper luminance weights
- **Image Negative**: Create inverted color version of the image
- **Thresholding**: Convert to binary black/white image based on configurable threshold
- **Gaussian Blur**: Apply 3x3 Gaussian blur filter for image smoothing
- **Automated Workflow**: Complete processing pipeline from PNG to processed outputs

## Requirements

- Icarus Verilog (iverilog) for simulation
- Python 3 with PIL/Pillow library
- GTKWave (optional, for viewing waveforms)

## Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

1. Place your input image as `input.png` (will be resized to 128Ã—128)
2. Run the full processing pipeline:
```bash
make
```
### Output Images
- **gray_output.png**:	Grayscale version
- **negative_output.png**:	Color-inverted image
- **binary_output.png**:	Black/white thresholded
- **blurred_output.png**:	Smoothed with Gaussian blur

### Makefile Targets
```bash
make           # Full processing pipeline
make simulate  # Run Verilog simulation only
make convert   # Generate output PNGs
make view      # Open waveforms (GTKWave)
make clean     # Remove generated files
```

## Requirements

- Python with Pillow library

- Icarus Verilog (iverilog)

- GTKWave (optional for waveform viewing)

- Make (for build automation)
